      <p><big>What am I going to do after Class12?</big> More than the terror of answering your family, friends,
        neighbours,
        and random strangers, is the terror of answering this question yourself. At this age, Class 12 and what
        comes after it is a life-defining moment. What you pursue should be your dream. It could be science,
        arts, and so on. With so many paths to choose from, it can be daunting. This website "Career Canvas"
        hopes to make your
        life easier by providing you with some of the top career options you can take after 12th Science.
        <br>
        Career options after 12th science do not just stop at technical fields. It does not stop at medicine or
        management. There is much more. Each field has its potential. You can take arts or humanities. You can
        go into fashion design and much more. <br><br>


        <big>Why Pursue Science?</big><br>
        Every country focuses on developing education in the following STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
        and Mathematics). Scientific thoughts, methods, and inquiry have built the world. Our modern life has
        evolved out of myriad inventions in different spectrums of science and technology. <br>

        From enhancing our life expectancy to probing deeper into space, science has brought about era-defining
        changes in our lives. We can observe applications all around us. Computer applications can now move
        infrastructures of the world (buildings, any type of machines and the like). Research in all fields
        (physics, chemistry, biology, to name a few) is creating spellbound creations.

            <p>Aerospace engineering is a captivating field that combines principles from aeronautical
              engineering
              and astronautical engineering.
              Aerospace engineering involves the design, development, testing, and production of
              aircraft,
              spacecraft, and related systems and equipment.<br>
              Branches: <br>
              Aeronautical Engineering: Focuses on aircraft design and operation within Earth’s
              atmosphere.
              <br>
              Astronautical Engineering: Deals with spacecraft design and space exploration beyond
              Earth’s
              atmosphere. <br>
              As a future aerospace engineer, you could contribute to space exploration, national
              defense,
              and
              commercial aviation.
